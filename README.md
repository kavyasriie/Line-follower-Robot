# Line-follower-Robot
Line follower robot is autonomous that means it automatically follows a line which is pre-defined.Generally, it follows a black line on a white surface or a white line on a black surface.
Reading the pre-defined line by IR sensor array which is installed on the front-down side of the robot and sends those readings to the Arduino.
The ATMega controller which is built in on Arduino analyze those readings and do the particular operations.
Three wheels are used, 2 wheels are on the back part connected with the motors and one independent wheel on the front middle part of the robot. On straight line, the speed is fast and on a turn,speed is relatively slow depending on turn angle.
